            <h1>Block by Block: Decoding Roblox Wonders | 1/27/24</h1>
            
            <p>It’s been some time since the last blog post right? Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to post due to the fact that I had the <b>Coronavirus</b> and have been very sick. Luckily, I am doing much better and I finally came up with the perfect article. So far we’ve talked about games such as <em>Minecraft</em>, <em>Toontown Online</em>, and <em>New Super Mario Bros.</em>, but today we are going to tackling another game that also has been a big part of my life. This game is called <em>Roblox</em>, and it has been around since <b>2006</b>.</p>

            <p>Created by two individuals named <em>Dave Baszucki</em> and <em>Erik Cassel</em>, Roblox appeals to a diverse audience consisting of children, teenagers, and adults alike. If you want to play, head on over to www.roblox.com and sign up for a free account. You’ll be asked to come up with a username, a password, and an email. After you sign up, you’ll be taken to the homepage where you can explore games, connect with friends, and discover various features of the platform!</p>
            
            <p>There’s the Shop where you can purchase cool items for your character to wear. There are some free items that you can get, but most items require some sort of payment. Roblox has an in game currency called <em>Robux</em>. The most common way to obtain Robux is to pay for them using real life money. Besides the Shop, Roblox has millions of user made games that are available to play. Users can build their own game from scratch and have people play it! Doesn’t that sound cool? People have built things such as <b>Neighborhoods</b>, <b>Theme Parks</b>, <b>Obstacle Courses</b>, and <b>Survival Games</b>.</p>

            <p>Besides the Shop and making games, users can make their own group. A group is to create a collective entity within the platform for users to connect, collaborate, and socialize. People create all kinds of different groups. Once they create the group, they can add a group logo as well as a group description. There are many different types of groups, such as <b>Fan Groups</b>, <b>Clans/Guilds</b>, <b>Roleplay Groups</b>, and <b>Social Groups</b>.</p>

            <p>Roblox is a great game and I have had a great experience playing it. I have been playing the game since 2010, which was a <b>long time</b> ago! Back then, the website was much more simpler compared to how it is run now! My username is <b>TwistedVenturer</b>. Who knows, maybe we’ll run into each other! Until next time.</p>
