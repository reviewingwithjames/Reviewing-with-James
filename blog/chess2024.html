            <h1>Checkmate: Exploring the World of Chess | 4/2/24</h1>
            
            <p>Welcome back to another blog post and today we are going to be talking about the history of the oldest board game, how it came to be, and how it works. The board game <b>Chess</b> was founded in India during the Gupta Empire, around the 6th century AD.</p>

            <p>To start things off, let’s talk about what this game is. Chess is a two player turn taking game played on a <b>chessboard</b> consisting of 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid of alternating dark and light colors.  Each player has a total of <b>16 pieces</b>, <b>8 Pawns, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 2 Bishops, 1 Queen, 1 King</b>. The objective is to capture the opponent’s King. This game involves lots of patience, it is not something that goes by fast, usually. You sit directly across from your opponent. Both players have equal access to the entire board, which is divided into two equal halves. You take turns with your opponent, carefully deciding where you want the pieces to move. The Pawns can move only straight, the first time you decide to move the Pawn it can move two spaces, otherwise it can only move in one direction in one space per turn. The Rooks can move horizontally or vertically and can move any number of spaces. The Knights move in a weird way, in an <b>L</b> shape, two squares in one direction, then one square perpendicular to that direction. The Bishops move diagonally, any number of squares. They move both forward and backward diagonally. The Queen, the most powerful piece, can move in any direction, except like a Knight. The King, the most valuable piece, can move one square in any direction. It however cannot move to a square that is threatened by an opponents piece, because that would put it in <b>check</b>.</p>
            
            <p>Now, what is check you may ask? Check is a situation where a player’s king is under threat of being captured by the opponent and requires immediate attention. <b>Checkmate</b> is when there is no way out for the King, then the game finishes. Most of the time, when people play Chess with each other, they do not use a timer. However, in competitive matches such as in tournaments, there is a timer which ensures that a player cannot take an excessive amount of time for their moves. <b>Thank you for taking the time to read this post about Chess. If you feel perhaps you are now interested in playing if you don’t own yourself a Chess set, I recommend going down to your local store and purchasing one</b>.</p>
