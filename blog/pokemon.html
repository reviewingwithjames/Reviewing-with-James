            <p>Created by <b>Game Freak</b>, a Japanese video game development company, Pokemon has been around since <b>1996</b> with the launch of <em>Pokémon Red and Green</em> in Japan. In the Pokémon games, you start out in your hometown. The goal is to capture Pokémon, which are virtual creatures that you can use to battle other wild Pokémon to level them up. In addition, you must fight trainers with other Pokémon and have battles with them.</p>
            
            <p>Furthermore, you must collect badges from Gym Leaders to progress through the game. There are a total of <b>8 different gym leaders</b> to fight against. You’ll have to train your Pokémon to be prepared for these fights. When you defeat a Gym Leader, you receive a gym badge. When you get <b>8 gym badges</b>, you can take on the Elite Four which are a series of 4 tough battles and then an additional Champion battle. If you manage to defeat the Champion, you will be the new Champion and be entered into the Hall of Fame.</p>

            <p>Pokémon has and continues to be a big part of my life. Whenever I boot up a game, I am immediately hit with a dosage of nostalgia. I totally recommend you play if you don’t already. <b>Gotta Catch Em’ All<b/>.</p>
