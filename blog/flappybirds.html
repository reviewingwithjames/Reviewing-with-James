            <h1>The Phenomenon That Took the World by Storm | 2/28/24</h1>
            
            <p>It’s finally that time again and today’s topic is probably going to bring some smiles to those who remember, back a <b>decade ago</b>. There used to be a game available on the App Store named <em>Flappy Birds</em>. For those of you who don’t know, the game was created by someone named <em>Dong Nguyen</em> in 2013. On February 8th, 2014, the app was taken down because the creator felt guilty that it was so addicting. </p>

            <p>For those of you who don’t know, Flappy Birds was a game where you are a bird and your goal is to fly past openings in pipes. The objective is fly past as many openings as you can. There are two pipes perpendicular to each other, with a small opening in the middle. The pipes are randomized, so each pair of pipes might be higher or lower than the previous one. Here’s the catch, when you hit a pipe, the bird falls to the ground and you have to restart from the beginning. </p>
            
            <p>The goal was simply to pass through as many openings as possible. Ultimately, it’s up to you to determine how far you can go. The game always keeps your highest score available. The game was adored by fans across the globe before its closure. However, since then, there have been a lot of fan made remakes of the game. There is a game currently out on the App Store called <b>Loopy Bird</b>, and it closely resembles the original game. However, there are different birds that you can unlock and they come with different abilities. In addition, you can unlock the classic retro bird from the original game. If you manage to get Loopy Bird, feel free to <b>contact us on Instagram</b> and tell us about it! I loved playing it ten years ago, and I was really saddened to see it go. Now that the game is back, I can relieve the nostalgia.</p>
